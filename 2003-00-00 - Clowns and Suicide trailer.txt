It's not about feeling sad, or regretful about Brian's death.
He's dead.
And I can do nothing to change that now.
But what I can do is look forward to all the beautiful human moments that I'm still here to see that Brian never will.
Do you want me to throw you the keys down?
Yeah, maybe?
Ow!
The way I'm going to remember Brian is by thinking of him every time I see something wonderful.
I get my clothes from the Apheds (?) bin in the middle of the night.
It's embarassing, you filthy bitch.
(?) isn't really coming tonight.
Hey, Mickey.
Hey.
(?)
You going to Matilda's tonight?
Rowboat?
Did you just say the word "rowboat" in the form of a question?
Is it about time for a vigil?
Ow, my heart!
Well, I like to think that Brian brought out the best in Parker.
For women.
Women have to be sort of attractice.
(?) galore.
How was that basketball camp you tried to start?
I don't play basketball.
If you're gonna wear (?) Brian, then you're freaking idiots.
I thought I was ruining everything or something?
So, uh, you're into sports, right?
I think it's one of the strongest pieces I've ever got.
That's so sweet.
Let's see it.
Shoe trouble?
Okay, listen carefully.
I don't want to alarm you, but there's a bear in the lobby.
