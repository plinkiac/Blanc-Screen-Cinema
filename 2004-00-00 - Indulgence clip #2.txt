What did you get on your mid-term, hun?
I got a B+.
I think I deserved an A, but Professor Anderson's a real jerk.
Now, hun, a B is nothing to be ashamed of.
Oh, you're right, dear.
Of course I'm right.
Life is grand.
We're young, white, American college students.
The world is our oyster.
You and I will be together forever.
Oh, Chad.
