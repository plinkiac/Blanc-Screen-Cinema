    what kind of liquid?
    could be interesting to see the variables involved in how the wax would hold up with various forms of liquid in the cup..
    possibly run sort of a mock race with several plastic bk cups (large) on your dresser with differing liquid carbonations (i.e mountain dew, coke, dr.pep, Tab) and see which is the first to create a leak on the bottom..just a thought

        that is such a wonderful Idea!
        I'm gonna go through the Burger King Drive through today and order sixe extra-large drinks.
        I'm putting my bets on the slurpees they sell there, they'd have a head start on the other liquids cause they are frozen and would have to melt.
        I think we should start a poll!!
        we can give a way free tapes to the winner.

            I'm guessing Mountain Dew would dissolve the thing fastest.
            I dunno why, it just seems more acidic to these eyes.
            And, as the Dana Carvey show pointed out, it looks EXACTLY like, uh, "liquid sunshine."

  GMP just keeps getting better all the time!!! I love this new site!
  Rumors on the street indicate Unique Thift store, Markham, running near empty on merchandise.
  --correlation--
  Q: Will/has The Long Walk Home surpass(ed) all preexisting GMP production costs?

    I manage this stupid site and if Mike Stokalasa would ever give me anything new to put on it, I would.
    Loyal GMP fans, send Mike lots and lots of hate mail.
    Tell him you want more GMP news!
    Tell him to give Jay more pictures to put up!
    Tell him to #### a donkey!

YOU GUYS SUCK! - REAPER 2/17/2002, 9:13 am (archive.ph/mOStJ)
  The Long Walk Home is the worst piece of trash I've ever seen.
  How can you even call it a movie?
  Mike, you have to be the worst director I've ever come across.
  If all your work is as bad as TLWH, maybe you should consider another hobby, like collecting stamps or something.

            Its kinda funny that Garret's girlfriends last name is McConnell isn't it.
            And everyone knows I'm Garret's dad. We're one big happy family. Well, me and Mariana are anyway =).
