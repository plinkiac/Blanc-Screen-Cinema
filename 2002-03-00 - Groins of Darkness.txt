We can do anything by working with each other.
We are here on set with George Lucas for the taping of the Episode II of "Ow, My Clones!"
Mr. Lucas, I don't know if I can perform against a blue screen constantly.
I need other actors to--
Oh, oh!
Fuck you!
This is my first journey to GMP land.
And the first thing that happens when we get here is, we get to Mr. Mike Stoklasa's house, and my eye swells up.
Not, not a good, uh, not a good sign.
Oh, my god.
I got in, and they left me in the plane for twenty minutes.
Sir, I don't know who you are.
Why are you running up to us?
Fuck!
Fuck!
Well, this is gonna be an exciting week.
Oh, shit.
Oh, we did our first injury.
I just split my lip right open.
Um, I'm sorry for punching Mr. Mike Stoklasa.
He, like me, has just, um, lost his voice due to the satanic cold given to us by Mr. Rich Evans's clone.
Fucking lamp fell on my head!
Ow, my fucking arm!
Ow, my fucking groin!
Ow!
Oh, fuck.
Look at that bruise.
Our mass destruction of this house continues.
Ow, my tripod.
Oh, and if we're documenting injuries, uh, Mr. Mike Stoklasa's, uh, has a broken--
His heart is broken.
He has broken heart.
Blink for the camera what you're doing here.
I'm poking Christmas lights through a sheet of insulation board in the attempt of making a control panel for an alien spacecraft.
I, ow, my movie.
How do you feel about our entire stay at the Rich Evans house?
Sick.
Sick.
Lots of sickness going on, eh?
Uh-huh.
When will the hurting stop?
Garrett.
Hi.
This is the first thing we've shot in Milwaukee so far.
What do you think about Milwaukee?
There's been far less accidents, far less injuries, and a lot more depressions.
And far less enthuisasm.
And far less enthuisasm.
Cuz, like, the minute we came to Milwaukee, basically everybody stopped caring.
Do you even know your character's name?
Julie.
Oh, so she does.
So we, uh, so we shot all of the blue screen stuff with Lisa.
And then we took down the blue screen.
And then, uh, someone wised up and remembered that we didn't get all the blue screen stuff.
This is so retarded.
That's it.
They're about to leave.
Any last words?
Um, go fuck yourself.
Yeah, go fuck yourself.
I don't have anything to say.
I don't know what happened, but sooner or later, I'll figure it out.
Was a movie involved?
I think something happened where we made a movie.
I don't know--
Oh, my god.
What the f--
Bye all.
Bye.
Garrett.
I loved working on this movie.
It was the nicest movie shot of my life.
Oh, god.
I'm dead.
Bye, guys.
Someone drag his corpse to the car, and I'll ship him back to L.A. in a box.
I'm kinda scared, and sad, and happy all at once.
