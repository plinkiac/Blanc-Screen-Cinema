Hey, Doug.
You ever play that game Battleship when you were a kid?
Was that the one with the hippos and the marbles, and you go pound on the thing?
No, no, that was--
Then what one was that?
Doug, the hippo--
No, it's not.
I would remember that.
What a great game.
Yeah.
Doug, the thing about battleship is, you got all your battleships, and then you got your biggest ship.
That's your battleship.
All right.
Okay.
I follow you.
If your battleship gets sunk, you lose the game.
Uh-huh.
I'm not following you, but yeah, go ahead.
I feel like my battleship's been sunk.
Wow.
That is really obtuse.
Doug, could you at least pretend to care?
Oh...no.
YOu know what was a sweet fucking game, was that Mouse Trap.
The thing about Mouse Trap is nobody actually played Mouse Trap.
You'd set it up, and as a child, it took fucking three hours to set up.
And then all you wanted to do was knock it down.
